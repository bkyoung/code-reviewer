# HTTP API Client Implementation Checklist

Status: Weeks 1-3 Complete - All Providers Implemented & Tested
Started: 2025-10-21
Updated: 2025-10-21

## Goal
Replace stub/static LLM clients with real HTTP implementations for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama, enabling actual code review functionality with production LLM APIs.

## Overview

Currently all providers use static/stub clients:
- OpenAI: Uses `openai.NewStaticClient()` returning canned responses
- Anthropic: Uses `nil` client
- Gemini: Uses `nil` client
- Ollama: Uses `nil` client

This batch implements production HTTP clients with proper error handling, retries, and rate limiting.

## Priority Order

1. **OpenAI** (most common, well-documented API)
2. **Anthropic** (Claude - popular for code review)
3. **Ollama** (local, no API key required)
4. **Gemini** (Google)

## Dependencies to Add

```bash
# No new dependencies needed - using stdlib net/http
# All providers use REST APIs compatible with net/http
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (with mocks)
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/openai/...
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/anthropic/...
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/ollama/...
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/gemini/...

# Integration tests (with mock HTTP server)
go test -tags=integration ./internal/adapter/llm/...

# Manual tests (requires API keys and real services)
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ./cr review branch main --target HEAD

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... ./cr review branch main --target HEAD

# Ollama (requires Ollama running locally)
ollama serve &
./cr review branch main --target HEAD

# Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=... ./cr review branch main --target HEAD
```

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All unit tests passing
- [x] All integration tests passing
- [x] Manual tests successful with real APIs
- [x] Code coverage >80% for HTTP client packages
- [x] Error handling comprehensive (timeouts, rate limits, auth failures)
- [x] Retry logic tested and working
- [x] Response parsing handles all known formats
- [x] API keys loaded from config and environment
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Security review passed (no API keys in logs)

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: <1% failure rate for transient errors (should retry successfully)
- **Performance**: 95th percentile response time <30 seconds for typical review
- **Error Handling**: All error types have clear, actionable messages
- **Cost Tracking**: Accurate token counting within 5% of provider billing
- **Documentation**: Each provider has working example in docs

## Notes

- Start with OpenAI (most mature API, best docs)
- Test thoroughly with mock servers before hitting real APIs
- Implement rate limit handling from day 1 (429 responses are common)
- Use context.Context throughout for cancellation support
- Keep API-specific code isolated to each provider package
- Extract common logic to shared http utilities package
- Never log full API keys (mask to last 4 chars only)
- Consider implementing request/response recording for debugging
- Add instrumentation for observability (duration, tokens, cost)

## Risk Mitigation

**API Changes**: Version lock known-good API versions in docs
**Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
**Costs**: Add token counting and cost estimation (Phase 4 budget enforcement)
**Security**: Never log credentials, use environment variables
**Reliability**: Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
**Testing**: Comprehensive mock server for CI without API keys
