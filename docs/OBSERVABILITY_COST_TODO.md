# Observability & Cost Tracking Implementation Checklist

Status: Planning → In Progress
Started: 2025-10-21
Updated: 2025-10-21

## Goal
Add observability (logging, metrics, duration tracking) and cost tracking (token counting, cost estimation) to all HTTP LLM clients. This provides visibility into API usage, helps debug issues, and prepares for Phase 4 budget enforcement.

## Overview

Currently the HTTP clients lack:
- Request/response logging for debugging
- Duration tracking for performance monitoring
- Token usage tracking for cost estimation
- Cost calculation per provider
- Structured output for analysis

This batch adds these capabilities while maintaining clean architecture and testability.

- Metrics: stdlib types
- Cost: simple multiplication

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/http/... -v
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/openai/... -v
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/anthropic/... -v
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/ollama/... -v
go test ./internal/adapter/llm/gemini/... -v

# Integration tests
go test ./internal/usecase/review/... -v

# Manual testing with observability
DEBUG=1 ./cr review branch HEAD --base HEAD~1

# Check cost tracking
./cr review branch HEAD --base HEAD~1 | grep -i cost
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All unit tests passing (target: 50+ new tests)
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] API keys properly redacted in all logs
- [ ] Duration tracking works for all providers
- [ ] Token counts match provider API responses
- [ ] Cost calculations within 5% of actual billing
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] Manual testing with all 4 providers successful
- [ ] No performance regression (<10ms overhead per request)

## Success Metrics

- **API Key Security**: 0% API key exposure in logs
- **Cost Accuracy**: ≤5% variance from provider billing
- **Performance**: <10ms overhead for logging/metrics
- **Coverage**: >80% test coverage for new code
- **Usability**: Clear, actionable log messages

## Notes

- Keep logging opt-in via config (don't spam output by default)
- Use structured logging (JSON) for machine parsing
- Redact API keys even in debug mode
- Document pricing data source and update frequency
- Consider future: export metrics to Prometheus/OpenTelemetry
- Pricing may change - document as of implementation date
- Token counting from API responses (not estimated locally)

## Risk Mitigation

**API Key Leaks**: Comprehensive redaction tests, code review
**Performance**: Benchmark logging overhead, use conditional logging
**Pricing Changes**: Document data sources, add update dates
**Log Volume**: Make logging configurable, support log levels
**Cost Calculation Errors**: Validate against real billing data
